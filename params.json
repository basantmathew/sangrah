{"name":"Sangrah","tagline":"Sangrah is a simple Library Management System built using Ruby on Rails.","body":"### About\r\nAt Samyukti, we wanted to create something small, meaningful for us to teach, learn and practice Ruby on Rails. We had then come up with a simple Library Management web application to explore Ruby on Rails. As the project progressed, it seemed a right decision to make it an open source software for the benefit of larger community. We intend to maintain this as a stable software in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nA few things that come into our mind when we hear 'Library' are books, authors, copies, memberships, members etc. We chose to call books and authors as items and creators respectively, to make it a little generic and go beyond the scope of just books.\r\n\r\nThe features include,\r\n\r\n* Manage _Items_ with _Creators_ and _Copies_\r\n* Manage _Memberships_ and _Members_\r\n* _Issue_ an item\r\n* _Reserve_ an item\r\n* Record _Receipts_ towards membership fees, fines and contributions\r\n* Dashboard and reports\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to keep simple relationships between the entities for keeping the design and application simple. Thus, one issue transaction can have only one copy. However, to make the issue process faster, we allow cloning issues, reservations, books, copies and all such things.\r\n\r\nOther features include,\r\n\r\n* Mobile ready, using Bootstrap framework\r\n* User authentication and authorization\r\n* A public page\r\n* Member access (under development)\r\n* Settings (under development)\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\nSangrah is built with Ruby on Rails (4.1.0) and PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\nPlease refer the licenses directory for different components used in this project.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe steps to install the software is given in the README of the repository. At the moment, we recommend installing in one of the Linux variants for production use.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots, Demo?\r\n\r\nComing soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
